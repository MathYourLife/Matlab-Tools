KF_NonUniform_Timestamp.m - Kalman Filtering with a Non-Uniform Timestep

This simulates a noisy second order system, and uses the noisy measurement
provided at irregular intervals to estimate the state using a Kalman Filter.

A regular implementation of the kalman filter would predetermine the 
state space matrices, but become less effective as the size of the 
timestep during a simulation varies.  This code creates a function_handle 
to generate the appropriately sized state space matrices during runtime.

The code is well documented as to provide insight into the purpose
of each step and the calculations that are being used.
